# TextBasedGame

CS-100 Python

I was tasked to create a text based game for my python class. I was able to develop my game over the class period. I created a flowchart, pseudocode, and final code for this project. 

Game Premise:
A captured American spy finds himself in a Gulag cell in Siberia. There are  4 prison cells connected by 3 blocks. Each cell contains an inmate (item). One of these cells contains the prison guard (villain). As the American spy you must convince 4 inmates to overthrow the prison with you using a map and a weapon. The inmates will join you if you can correctly answer questions about Russia. Get all 4 answers correct and you will be set free. If you run into the prison guards before you collect your comrades you will be sent back to your cell.
